Development of a printed circuit board and its respective manual, which instructs a user on its functionality, implementation and behavior. The manual includes the electrical circuit, the board schematic and the validation board developed. All electronic components used were specified. Therefore, from that document, in which the information has been rigorously compacted and systematized, it is possible to manufacture and implement the designed board.
